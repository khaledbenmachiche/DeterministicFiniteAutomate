# Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) Implementation in Golang

This project contains a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) implemented in the Go programming language.

## Overview

A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) is a mathematical model that recognizes a set of strings based on a defined set of states and transition rules. This implementation showcases the basic structure of a DFA.

## Files

- `main.go`: Contains the main code implementing the DFA, its states, transitions, and string recognition.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, providing information about the project.

## Prerequisites

To run this DFA implementation, ensure you have Go installed. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/khaledbenmachiche/deterministic-finite-automate-DFA/
   cd deterministic-finite-automate-DFA
2. Compile
   ```bash
   go build main.go
3. execute:
   ```bash
    ./main
